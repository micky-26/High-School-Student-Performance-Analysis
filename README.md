# High-School-Student-Performance-Analysis
I have analyzed student’s performance in high school from Portuguese. For this project, the data which is used contains the following attributes:

Worked on an Excel project called "High School Student Performance Analysis" and created charts and graphs to convert the data into meaningful insights. This project aims to analyze the student’s performance based on various factors like age, address, distance, travel time, grade, etc.

The following steps were performed in this project:
1. Data cleaning to remove any duplicates.
2. Replacing Null Values
3. Created custom columns to extract additional information from the dataset.
4. Generated Pivot tables, Charts, and Graphs to summarize the data and present it visually, making it easier to understand.
